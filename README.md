# WP-childtheme
This is just a very basic WordPress childtheme for theme development. Feel free to use - just make sure you update the styles.css file accordingly - especially the name of the folder containing the parent theme! And of course delete or modify the screenshot png.

Once you've adjusted it upload to the WordPress theme directory and then activate it via the Appearance > Themes in the WordPress admin area.
